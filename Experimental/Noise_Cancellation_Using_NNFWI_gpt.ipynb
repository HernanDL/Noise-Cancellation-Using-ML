        "This Colab notebook implements a Full-Waveform Inversion (FWI) model using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) combined with LSTM layers. The generator network is designed to produce inverse waveforms, while the discriminator ensures the quality of the generated waveforms. The approach is based on the paper \"Integrating Deep Neural Networks with Full-waveform Inversion: Reparametrization, Regularization, and Uncertainty Quantification\" ([arXiv:2012.11149](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.11149.pdf))."
